# injectorCFDModelling
WIP CFD model of injectors using openFOAM 2006  
Currently using interPhaseChangeFoam, from modified cavitating bullet tutorial
This uses incompressible fluid model, as seen in CIRA paper

<h1>notes</h1>
<h2>mesh</h2>
<p>
- roughly 98% hexahedral, 2% prisms

- generated by: 
    - creating a wedge using blockmesh
    - discarding the plate modelled in cad using SHM from the wedge
    - collapsing the faces on the wedge knife edge using collapseEdges
    - manually changing the patch types for side1 & side2 to cyclical
- so far I've used a cyclical BC, but it's possible wedge would be better

- when finding the cells to discard, I've been using an axisymmetric wedge made in Fusion360 of the correct size etc,
    but i believe it would work just as well using an stl of the whole injector plate
    
- cell refinement near the injector is created using grading in the x direction 
- may have to use multiple blocks & merge them to create mesh similar to UoT, with defined refinement around each injector hole.
    Doing this by hand sounds mind numbing if running a decent no. of cases, a matlab or python script could automate it somewhat

<h2>turbulence</h2>
<p>
- currently no turbulence model implemented<br/>
- Piotr proposes k-epsilon, as seen in propeller tutorial case<br/>
</p>
    
<h2>cavitation</h2>
<p>
- currently SchnerrSauer coeffs are exactly as seen in the cavitating bullet tutorial<br/>
- can calculate these using Rayleighâ€“Plesset equation (see paper in literature for more details<br/>
</p>
    
<h2>current models</h2>
<p>
- all run as laminar sims<br/>
- appear to show cavitation nicely, which is promising<br/>
- do not yet know how to extract mass/volumetric flow that would allow us to see if choking is occuring<br/>
