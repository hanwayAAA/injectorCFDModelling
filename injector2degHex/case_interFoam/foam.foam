to run sim:

- cp -r 0.orig/* 0/
- cp -r ../mesh/constant/polyMesh constant/
- setFields (this tells where we will have liquid to begin with)
//DONT DO THIS: - potentialFoam -pName p_rgh -writephi (calculates internalField of phi and U)
- interPhaseChangeFoam

**optional**
for parallel:
- decomposePar
- mpirun -np 6 interPhaseChangeFoam -parallel (6 for my 6 core machine)
- reconstructPar 
for parallel & minor speed increments:
- mpirun -np 6 interPhaseChangeFoam -parallel > log.interPhaseChangeFoam &  (this reduces the difference between ExecutionTime and ClockTime)
- tail -f log.interPhaseChangeFoam (this allows you to follow it as usual)

- to quit execution while running in background use fg to bring it back into the terminal, where CTRL C will kill it

to re-run:
- rm -r processor*
- rm -r 0.* (DONT THIS WILL DELETE 0.orig)
- rm -r 0/*
then run commands as usual

to then fully reset:
- rm -r 0/* 
- rm -r constant/polyMesh
